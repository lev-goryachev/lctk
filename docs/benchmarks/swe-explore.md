# SWE-Explore warm-index benchmark

This document is the executable measurement contract for [ADR-0030](../adr/0030-warm-index-code-exploration-benchmark.md). It measures whether an already indexed LCTK project improves code exploration by the same agent. Index construction time is deliberately outside every measured arm.

The public SWE-Explore row supplies ground truth but not the issue text or base commit. The harness therefore joins it by exact `instance_id` with an independently pinned SWE-bench source JSONL containing `instance_id`, `repo`, `base_commit`, and `problem_statement`. Duplicate or missing identifiers are fatal.

[`swe-explore-config.example.json`](swe-explore-config.example.json) documents the complete schema. Replace every marker, store the runnable copy under ignored `.artifacts/`, and pin the SHA-256 of the exact exported issue JSONL. The example is intentionally not runnable with placeholder identities.

## Campaign matrix

Run four arms while keeping provider-specific results separate:

| Client | Native control | Warm LCTK treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Codex CLI | `codex exec --ephemeral --json --ignore-user-config` with read-only repository access and web, apps, remote plugins, multi-agent, and memory disabled | the same executable, model, effort, sandbox, prompt, timeout, and budget with only the approved LCTK MCP configuration added; its read-only tools use the documented server-scoped `default_tools_approval_mode="approve"` so non-interactive execution does not cancel them |
| Claude Code | non-persistent print mode whose available built-ins are exactly `Read`, `Glob`, and `Grep`, with an empty strict MCP configuration | the same settings with only the approved project-bound LCTK MCP server and its explicit read-only code-intelligence allowlist added |

The treatment trace must contain a successfully completed LCTK MCP tool call. A native trace containing one is invalid. The identical prompt requires both arms to call `lctk_benchmark.project_info` first and use LCTK as their primary exploration channel when that server is available; otherwise they use built-in read-only tools. It also requires exploration only, no changes, and exactly one final `RELEVANT_FILES:` block with at most `top_k` ordered `path:start-end` regions and no other final text.

The treatment allowlist is exactly `project_info`, `exact_search`, `file_outline`, `find_definition`, `find_references`, `code_search_semantic`, `callers_find`, `callees_find`, `dependency_path`, `impact_analyze`, and `repository_map`. LCTK command, Git, and persistent-memory tools are not exposed.

## Per-instance sequence

1. Join the public benchmark record to the issue-source record by `instance_id`.
2. Verify the clean benchmark repository and exact `base_commit` before changing it.
3. If the object is absent, shallow-fetch exactly the declared commit from the validated public `https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git` source, then check it out while no arm is running.
4. Wait outside the measured interval until the LCTK watcher has no pending paths and exact, semantic, graph, and watcher generations are fresh and equal.
5. Run the first arm in a new non-persistent session, capture its complete machine-readable trace, and reject any repository change.
6. Restore the identical clean commit if necessary, repeat freshness preflight, and run the paired arm in another new session.
7. Alternate arm order deterministically from the instance identifier.
8. Reject the pair if the client version or provider-reported actual model differs between arms.
9. Parse and validate ordered regions against files in the exact checkout.
10. Score the saved prediction through the pinned official SWE-Explore evaluator. A repository-owned parity scorer may test orchestration, but it is not the publication authority.

## Primary and operational measures

The official metric set is `precision`, `recall`, `f1_score`, `hit_file_rate`, `noise_file_rate`, `hit_region_rate`, `noise_region_rate`, `weighted_core_coverage`, `context_efficiency`, `optional_coverage`, `ndcg_at_100`, `ndcg_at_300`, `ndcg_at_500`, `recall_at_100`, `recall_at_300`, `recall_at_500`, and `first_useful_hit`.

The primary product readout is the within-client paired delta for `weighted_core_coverage`, `context_efficiency`, `recall_at_300`, and `first_useful_hit`. Also retain elapsed agent seconds, input/output/cached/cache-creation/reasoning tokens when the client reports them, tool calls, invalid-output rate, timeout rate, and provider-reported cost, API duration, and turns where available. Any API-list-price equivalent is derived later from a campaign-pinned price table and remains distinct from provider-reported cost. Indexing telemetry is reported separately and never added to agent latency or cost.

## Paid campaign execution

Build one exact harness executable, create a runnable configuration under ignored `.artifacts/`, and validate it before selecting instances. The `manifest` command deterministically selects a repository-stratified sample. For a 20-instance pilot it first includes one instance from every joined repository, then fills the remaining slots by global SHA-256 rank; execution order is grouped by repository to reduce avoidable checkout and indexing work. The full Git commit is explicit because an executable digest alone does not identify the reviewed source.

```text
swe-explore-benchmark manifest --config CONFIG --campaign-id ID --count 20 --seed TEXT --harness-commit FULL_SHA --output MANIFEST
swe-explore-benchmark campaign --config CONFIG --manifest MANIFEST --output-dir OUTPUT --python PYTHON
```

The manifest pins the exact configuration, datasets, harness, clients, models, efforts, repositories, and base commits. Campaign startup rejects any digest, version, model, or effort drift before a paid arm starts. Before changing a checkout, preparation records a settled baseline generation. A changed commit is eligible only after exact, semantic, graph, and watcher state converge on a strictly newer generation; this prevents a fast Git switch from temporarily reusing the preceding checkout's still-fresh status.

Each paid arm writes into a unique attempt directory. Its raw machine-readable trace, normalized result, and official score become complete only when an immutable arm receipt references all three SHA-256 digests and the repository-owned parity scorer matches all 17 official metrics within `1e-12`. A pair receipt is published only after native and LCTK arms have matching client versions and provider-reported actual models. Interrupted and failed attempts remain diagnostic artifacts but are never included in an aggregate.

Resume validates every referenced digest and reuses a completed arm without calling the model again. Missing receipts cause a new attempt; malformed or modified receipts and artifacts are fatal. Progress reports are immutable snapshots rebuilt from receipts. They keep Codex and Claude separate and include all official means, all paired deltas, deterministic paired-bootstrap 95% intervals for the four primary metrics, elapsed time, token categories, LCTK calls, provider-specific cost and duration fields, and failed-attempt count. Raw traces and receipts remain the publication audit authority.

One exact model and effort per provider is the primary campaign contract. Model-tier and effort comparisons are separate pre-registered sensitivity manifests so they cannot be selected after observing the primary result.

## Single-run readiness gate

Mass testing is allowed only after all of these pass:

- configuration, dataset join, duplicate detection, path validation, output parsing, tool-isolation checks, scorer parity, timeout handling, and repository-mutation detection pass automated tests;
- a deterministic synthetic agent completes one native and one LCTK-shaped arm through the full artifact pipeline;
- a synthetic campaign proves immutable receipts, all-metric aggregation, resume without rerunning completed arms, and fatal digest verification after artifact modification;
- each locally runnable real client completes one native arm and one authorized LCTK arm on the same single instance;
- every treatment preflight records matching fresh generations and zero watcher pending paths;
- the official scorer accepts the emitted prediction JSONL;
- no OAuth token is copied, printed, or stored by the harness, and no IDE is launched.

An unavailable client or unapproved OAuth connection is a failed readiness gate, not a skipped success.

The accepted 2026-08-07 gate evidence is recorded in [the single-run readiness report](swe-explore-single-run.md).
