# Local Code ToolKit (LCTK)

> **Status:** public pre-alpha. Project registration, route-bound MCP, persistent exact and semantic search, syntax and graph intelligence, explicit project memory, transactional bootstrap/update/rollback, and a fail-closed release pipeline are implemented. Exact support claims remain limited to the evidence in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) and [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md).

Local Code ToolKit is a local, extensible MCP platform for software development. It decouples code intelligence, indexing, project memory, and command execution from any specific LLM or IDE.

The official Codex extension for VS Code is the first target client. The public MCP API is designed to support other compatible agents later without changing internal indexes or services.

## Target properties

- a separate MCP endpoint and runtime state for each registered project;
- enforced project scope: the model does not select a project through tool-call arguments;
- local persistent exact, symbol, AST, semantic, and graph indexes;
- automatic incremental indexing after files are saved;
- a shared control plane and reusable container images;
- a separate project-scoped runner;
- local operation without mandatory cloud APIs after components are installed;
- a minimal local Admin UI and one `lctk` command family;
- Windows 10 22H2 x86-64 as the first one-click product target;
- an LCTK-managed headless Podman machine on WSL2, with no Docker Desktop or Podman Desktop dependency.

Compatibility targets are not certified configurations yet. Hosted CI provides build and test evidence, while final installation certification still requires a clean Windows 10 22H2 host with virtualization enabled.

The initial official release is Windows amd64 only. macOS remains covered by source-build CI but has no published package.

## Install and open

Download `lctk-setup-<version>-windows-amd64.exe` from the GitHub Release and run it. In the native setup window, choose the installation directory and the runtime-data directory that will hold the WSL disk, OCI images, project indexes, and project memory; then select **Review and install** and accept the exact plan. The initial open-source installer is intentionally unsigned: Windows can show **Windows protected your PC**, in which case select **More info** and **Run anyway**; an elevation dialog can identify the publisher as unknown. Setup independently verifies the Ed25519-signed component manifest plus every artifact size and SHA-256 digest, enables WSL2 when required, installs the private runtime, registers sign-in startup plus `LCTK` and `Uninstall LCTK` Start-menu shortcuts, and opens the native administrator window. A WSL2 prerequisite change can require one reboot; setup registers an exact one-time continuation.

No Go toolchain, Git, Docker Desktop, Podman Desktop, image build, browser-based administrator, or shell command is required. In the native administrator window, choose the project folder, add it, and select **Start**. Select the project to see its exact MCP URL and Codex setup steps. Remove any LCTK entry created by a pre-0.1.3 build, add the displayed Streamable HTTP URL in Codex, select **Authenticate**, then approve the incoming request in LCTK. LCTK never launches the IDE, edits its configuration, or shows a bearer token. Opening **LCTK** from the Start menu later reconnects to the daemon and opens a fresh authenticated native window. Removal is available from Windows Apps & Features, `Uninstall LCTK` in the Start menu, and the administrator window; it explicitly offers either project-state archives or complete removal.

## Automation and source workflow

```sh
lctk project add PATH          # register a folder; nothing is started
lctk project start PROJECT     # bring up its isolated container stack
```

The project is then reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:4444/projects/{project_id}/mcp`, serving up to eighteen tools according to the project's live capabilities:

- `project_info` — what this endpoint is bound to, what it can do, and how fresh its index is;
- `exact_search` — indexed literal and regular-expression search over the saved working tree, including files that are saved but not committed;
- `git_status` and `git_diff` — what has changed since the last commit, read-only, for a client that has no shell on the machine;
- `run_command` — the project's build, test, or lint, but only the ones the machine owner approved, and only by name;
- `file_outline` — syntax-derived declarations and parse status for one file;
- `find_definition` and `find_references` — bounded, name-matched declaration and reference lookup across supported source files;
- `code_search_semantic` — local conceptual search with syntax-aware chunks, lexical/vector rank evidence, model identity, and exact-versus-semantic generation freshness;
- `callers_find` and `callees_find` — bounded name-matched call evidence with ambiguity and generation provenance;
- `dependency_path` and `impact_analyze` — syntax-import routes and direct reverse-import/call evidence without type-resolution claims;
- `repository_map` — deterministic importance-ranked declarations inside an exact character budget;
- `memory_get`, `memory_search`, `memory_put`, and `memory_delete` — explicit persistent project knowledge with optimistic revisions, provenance, review/confidence labels, Git commit awareness, and hybrid retrieval.

The index follows edits on its own. Saving a file makes it searchable without any command; measured on this repository, a file written was found by search 0.2 seconds later. When the index cannot be brought up to date, the answer says so rather than looking current.

Around that:

- `lctk daemon` hosts the gateway, owner-approved per-project OAuth, and the filesystem watcher;
- `lctk bootstrap` for a read-only installation plan and confirmed immutable model/inference installation with a functional self-test;
- `lctk update` for a signed read-only release plan, candidate project health gates, atomic host activation, and verified rollback;
- `lctk project status/stop/restart/remove/reindex/watch/resources`, `lctk image`, `lctk settings`, and `lctk doctor` for the rest of the lifecycle;
- `lctk admin open` for the native administrator window over an API a project credential cannot reach;
- the scope of a request comes from the route, exact OAuth resource audience, and server-side registry, so a tool argument naming another project is ignored and a credential issued for one project is refused on another.

Automated tests cover setup planning, immutable downloads, runtime isolation, the CLI, gateway scope guarantees, search, watcher, and change journal. CI builds and tests on hosted Windows and macOS runners, builds OCI images on Linux, and constructs the unsigned Windows installer with a signed release manifest, checksums, and provenance attestations. Managed-runtime integration tests skip explicitly when the private LCTK machine is absent rather than being simulated.
